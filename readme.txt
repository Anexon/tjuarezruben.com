Cloudfront public URL: https://d3cf8yolaunmia.cloudfront.net/

This website is a portfolio of mine that uses Gatsby framework to generate static websites.
I have generated the static website files by building the project.

And performed the following actions:
* Create a public S3 bucket and configured for static website hosting.
* Uploaded the build files of the static website
* Created a Cloudfront distribution pointing to the URL domain of the S3 buckect created previously; redirecting all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
